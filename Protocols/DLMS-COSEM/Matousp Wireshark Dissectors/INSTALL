NOTES
-----
- DLMS parser is called by default on the communication that is transmitted over TCP ports 
  specified in hdlc.lua or dlms-wrapper.lua. If your DLMS communication is transmitted over 
  other ports, you can add your ports into the above mentioned files or you can right click 
  on the packet in the Wireshark and choose Decode As option where you select either HDLC 
  or DLMS-Wrapper based on your encapsulation.
- LUA support in Wireshark is required. Some Unix versions of Wireshark do not support LUA.
