The pcap "Modbus Firmware Update.pcapng" is a capture of an interaction between a connected laptop (172.17.0.249) and a General Electric N60 UR family relay (172.17.0.72).  Software used was Enervista UR Setup, the standard configuration software for GE UR family relays.  This software uses Modbus/TCP for its interaction.
The capture has two major interactions: the first is the downloading of a maintenance report and then upgrading the relay firmware.
